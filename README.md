Welcome to the Crop Disease Identification Model repository! This project utilizes deep learning to detect and identify crop diseases from images. Developed using TensorFlow, the app allows users to upload images of crops, predicts the potential disease affecting them, and provides valuable insights for early disease detection.

## 🌱 About
Crop diseases can significantly impact agricultural productivity and income for farmers worldwide. Early detection and identification of these diseases are crucial for implementing timely interventions to prevent crop damage. Our Crop Disease Identification Model aims to address this challenge by leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze crop images and accurately predict disease presence.
